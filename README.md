Image-to-Image Transformation
This repository contains the Python script image_to_image.py, which performs image transformations. This script can be used to process input images in various ways, such as resizing, applying filters, or performing other transformations depending on its code.

Overview
The image_to_image.py script is designed for users looking to apply transformations to images programmatically. The script accepts an input image, applies a specified transformation, and outputs the resulting image. This README provides instructions for setting up the environment, running the script, and modifying the transformations.

Prerequisites
To run this script, you will need:

Python 3.7+
The following Python libraries:
OpenCV (cv2) or PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing
NumPy for numerical operations (if needed)
